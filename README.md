# TicTacToe AI Networking  

## Description  
Explore how IoT, cloud integration, and AI come together in this innovative project. This repository features the networking component of a TicTacToe game with AI, built using Raspberry Pi and Sense HAT. The project integrates cloud-based score management, data visualization, and web interfaces, showcasing skills in data handling, Python programming, and IoT systems.  

## Key Features  

- **Cloud Integration:** Online scoreboard leveraging Google Sheets API for storing and retrieving game data.  
- **Data Visualization:** Fetch and display scores on the Raspberry Piâ€™s RGB LED matrix or via a web interface.  
- **Web Framework:** Flask-based web server for seamless user interaction and real-time data display.  
- **Networking Analysis:** Measured network parameters using Wireshark for optimized performance.  

## Project Objectives  

1. Store and manage player scores and moves in a cloud-based database.  
2. Visualize data on an RGB LED matrix or a dynamic webpage.  
3. Evaluate and implement networking methods and cloud services for optimal integration.  
4. Develop efficient Python scripts for cloud database interaction.  
5. Set up and manage a web server for hosting the game interface.  
6. Analyze network performance between Raspberry Pi and the cloud for reliability.  
7. Enable remote gameplay via a Flask-based web application. 


## Project Structure 

- **app.py:** Python script to integrate the game with Google Sheets API for online scoreboard functionality.  
- **main.py:** Core game logic and interaction with the Sense HAT module.  
- **ttsheet.json:** Configuration file for Google Sheets API access.  
- **webserver/:** Directory containing web server setup files.  
  - **index.html:** Webpage for displaying game data.  
  - **server.py:** Flask-based web server implementation.  
- **static/:** Contains CSS and JavaScript files for enhancing the web interface.


## Usage  

1. **Clone the repository:**  
   ```bash  
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/tictactoe-networking.git 

2. **Install the required dependencies:**
pip install -r requirements.txt

Configure the ttsheet.json file with your Google Sheets API credentials.

Run the main Python script to start the TicTacToe game:
python main.py

Optionally, run the web server using Flask to display game data on a webpage:
cd webserver/
python server.py
